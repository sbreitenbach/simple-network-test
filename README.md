Simple Network Test

I wrote the script to gather better data when troubleshooting my network with my internet service provider. 
It simply pings some host, in my case a cloud based virtual machine, and logs the result. 
It works well on a Raspberry Pi but it can run on any modern Windows, Mac, or Linux machine. 
I added an optional text message notification that is sent following an outage.
